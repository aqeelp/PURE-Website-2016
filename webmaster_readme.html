<h2>II. Website Maintenance and Revisions</h2>
<p>The following describes how to update the website to reflect the current state of the band.</p>

<h4>i. MEMBER BIOS</h4>
<p>To maintain the member bios, updates must be made to members.html, json/member_data.json, and img/members/.<br>
Information between these files and folders are linked by netID</p>

<pre>members.html</pre>
<p>
On this page, all current members are listed by instrument.<br>
Within this file, there are a series of div's each of the class list-group.<br>
In Bootstrap, this signifies a new list. These lists do not have automatic headers, so the first element is manually made to act as a header.<br>
The first child element of these div's signify which instrument the members of this list mainly play.<br>
Each following member should be of the following format (view source code):<br><br>
<a class="list-group-item member" href="#" id="aqeelp" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#member-info-modal">Aqeel Phillips '17</a><br><br>
The ID of this element MUST be the users netID. The netID is used to look up members' images.<br>
These 'a' elements do not link anywhere specifically, but do open each member's respective modal dialog, which is populated from json/member_data.json.
</p>

<pre>json/member_data.json</pre>
<p>
Each member has an entry in the 'members' object of this JSON file.<br>
When members join or leave the group, they should be added or removed to this JSON file.<br>
Changes made to this JSON file will be automatically reflected in the member modal dialog on members.html (note: members must be updated in the members.html lists manually).<br>
In this file, each member entry must have the <b>exact</b> same fields. They must not be misspelled, nor should any be omitted.<br>
It is not important that the member list is in alphabetical order, but it helps with organization.
</p>

<pre>img/members/</pre>
<p>
This folder contains all current member portraits for their bios.<br>
The title of each image file should be of the format: <i>NETID</i>.jpg.<br>
The file extension must be of <i>.jpg</i>, not <i>.jpeg</i> or anything else.
</p>

<h4>ii. REPERTOIRE</h4>
<p>For ease of updating, the all-time PURE repertoire is held in the following csv file:</p>

<pre>csv/repertoire.csv</pre>
<p>
This file contains two columns: song titles and their respective artists.<br>
This file should have no headers, it is purely data.<br>
This file does not need to be in any particular order, but it is helpful to sort it after making additions.</br>
The format of this file should not be altered (i.e., resave it in whatever format that your editor deemed best). The consequences of changing this are untested.
</p>

<pre>repertoire.html</pre>
<p>
Jquery code in this file automatically pulls in all of the songs from the repertoire.csv file.<br>
There is a list object that is automatically populated from the responses received from the csv file.<br>
The jquery code concludes by sorting the list by title, descending.
</p>

<h4>iii. UPCOMING SHOWS</h4>
<p>Upcoming events are automatically pulled from Google Calendars owned by PURE@PRINCETON.EDU.</p>

<pre>calendar.google.com</pre>
<p>
The calendars owned by PURE@ that are relevant to this site are 'PERFORMANCES' and 'EVENTS'.<br>
The performances calendar is strictly for shows.<br>
The events calendar contains all PURE events that are NOT shows - open houses, auditions, etc.<br>
There should not be overlap in the events between these two calendars (i.e., no duplicates between them).
</p>

<pre>index.html & upcoming_events.html</pre>
<p>
Jquery code in these files automatically pull in events via the Google Calendar API.<br>
The code for retrieving the events and generating the html elements are exactly the same.<br>
Any changes made to the code of one should probably be reflected in the other as well.<br>
NOTE: the index.html API call caps responses at 2. upcoming_events.html should show ALL upcoming events.
